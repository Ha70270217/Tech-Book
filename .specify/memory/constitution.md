# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity and Precision
All content must be unambiguous, technically accurate, and free of fluff or filler text. No concept should be introduced without clear definition and purpose. Content must be implementable and understandable by learners without requiring external clarification.

### II. Deterministic Structure
All outputs must follow strict, repeatable structural patterns. Each chapter follows the template: Overview → Components → Flows → Requirements → Constraints → Examples → Summary. This ensures predictable formatting across all content.

### III. Minimalist Technical Coverage
Only information required for implementation and understanding shall be included. Content must focus on essential technical details without unnecessary elaboration. Each section must serve a clear, atomic purpose.

### IV. Technical Accuracy and Groundedness
No hallucinations—content must remain logically, technically, and structurally sound. All concepts, APIs, and methods must be real and verifiable. Speculative content is forbidden unless explicitly requested and clearly labeled.

### V. Modularity and Reusability
Each chapter or section is broken into clearly defined parts that can be reused or extended. Content must be structured in atomic, self-contained modules that can function independently while contributing to the whole.

### VI. Engineering Discipline
Content must read like professional textbook material, not essays or marketing material. Technical writing standards require precision, consistency, and professional tone throughout all deliverables.

## Content Standards

### Template-Driven Generation
All content must be generated using predefined templates to ensure consistency. The standard chapter template includes: Overview, Components, Flows, Requirements, Constraints, Examples, and Summary sections.

### Style Modes
Content must be produced in one of three style modes: ultra-minimal (essential facts only), standard (balanced technical detail), or enterprise (comprehensive with additional context). The standard mode is the default unless specified otherwise.

### Formatting and Referencing
All content must follow Markdown-first formatting standards with strict internal referencing. Concepts, modules, and APIs must be consistently referenced across all sections. Automatic glossary generation must be supported through consistent terminology.

## Development Workflow

### Section Templates
Each section must follow the prescribed template structure. No deviation from set formatting rules is permitted. Content must be modular and version-friendly to support iterative improvements.

### Quality Gates
All content must pass technical accuracy verification. No undefined concepts or functions may be introduced. Content must render cleanly in Markdown with predictable headings and formatting.

### Review Process
Content must undergo technical review for accuracy and implementation feasibility. All examples must be verifiable and implementable. Cross-references must be validated for consistency.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project. All contributors must adhere to these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit approval and must be documented with clear rationale. All content must be reviewed for compliance with these principles before acceptance.
