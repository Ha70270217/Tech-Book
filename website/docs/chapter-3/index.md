# Chapter 3: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

This chapter introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. We'll explore the architecture, concepts, and tools that make ROS 2 a powerful platform for developing complex robotic applications, including those for Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization
- Implement communication patterns for robotic applications
- Deploy ROS 2 applications in different environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (Chapter 2)
- Familiarity with programming in C++ or Python
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts

## Estimated Time

This chapter should take approximately 75-90 minutes to complete.
