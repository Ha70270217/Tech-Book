# Chapter 4: Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Isaac)

## Overview

This chapter explores digital twin simulation technologies for robotics, focusing on Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim. We'll examine how these tools enable the development, testing, and validation of robotic systems in virtual environments before deployment in the real world, which is crucial for Physical AI applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept and importance of digital twin simulation
- Set up and configure Gazebo and Isaac Sim environments
- Create robot models and simulation scenarios
- Implement sensor simulation and physics modeling
- Transfer knowledge from simulation to real robots (sim-to-real)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals (Chapter 3)
- Basic knowledge of physics and mechanics
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts

## Estimated Time

This chapter should take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete.
