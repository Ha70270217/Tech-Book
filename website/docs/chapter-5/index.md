# Chapter 5: Vision-Language-Action Systems

## Overview

This chapter examines the integration of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action systems. We'll explore how these modalities work together to enable robots to perceive, understand, and act upon human instructions in complex environments, forming the foundation for advanced Physical AI applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of multimodal perception in robotics
- Implement vision-language models for robotic applications
- Design action planning systems that respond to natural language commands
- Integrate perception and action in real-world scenarios
- Evaluate the performance of vision-language-action systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Understanding of computer vision fundamentals
- Knowledge of natural language processing basics
- Familiarity with robotic control systems (Chapter 2)

## Estimated Time

This chapter should take approximately 75-90 minutes to complete.
